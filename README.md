# test-turtle
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N is given. A LOGO turtle stands at (0,0) heading North. It moves A[0] steps forward and turns by 90 degrees clockwise. Then it moves A[1] steps forward and turns clockwise by 90 degrees. And so on. For example, given:  A[0] = 1  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 2    A[3] = 5  A[4] = 4  A[5] = 4    A[6] = 6  A[7] = 3  A[8] = 2 The turtle walks as follows:  (0,0)   -> (0,1)     1st move, 1 step  North  (0,1)   -> (3,1)     2nd move, 3 steps East  (3,1)   -> (3,-1)    3rd move, 2 steps South  (3,-1)  -> (-2,-1)   4th move, 5 steps West  (-2,-1) -> (-2,3)    5th move, 4 steps North  (-2,3)  -> (2,3)     6th move, 4 steps East  (2,3)   -> (2,-3)    7th move, 6 steps South  (2,-3)  -> (-1  3)   8th move, 3 steps West  (-1,-3) -> (-1,-1)   9th move, 2 steps North In the 7th and 9th moves the turtle touches its previous path, namely:  at point (2,1) in the 7th move,  at point (2,-1) in the 7th move,  at point (-1,-1) in the 9th move Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a description of the turtle's walk in array A, returns the number of the first move in which the turtle touches its previous path, or 0 if no such situation occurs. For example, given array A as defined above, the function should return 7, because the turtle touches its previous path at point (2,1) in the 7th move. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.
